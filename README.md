Programming in python assignment 5
## Background
* What is diabetes type 1
* How does insulin work
* New treatments for automating insulin
* Use for modeling
   
## The problem
I will simulate the glucose levels of a diabetes type 1 patient, in the following four steps;
1.	A pharmacokinetic model, which models the concentration of insulin in blood against time. 
2.	A pharmacodynamic model, which models the drug effect, in this case blood glucose level.
3.	A model of glucose level rises with meals.
4.	A control program that adds insulin, so the blood glucose level returns to normal.
